Use =org-babel-demarcate-block= to easily split a large code block
into smaller ones.

- To filter a Dired buffer:
  - =% m= marks files whose names mark a regexp.
  - =t= toggles which files are marked.
  - =k= kills the lines containing marked files.
  - =g= to revert to the base view.

-  Type =C-u C-c C-q= to align all tags in the current buffer.
  
- =icomplete-mode= and =fido-vertical-mode= can be used to create a
  =vertico= like minibuffer experience.

- =C-h C-q= will toggle display of a window showing popular commands
  and their bindings.

- =C-x C-e= in any buffer evaluates the Lisp form immediately before
  point and prints its value in the echo area.

- =M-x describe-keymap= allows us to see all keybindings for a
  specific mode.

- =C-u M-x eshell= to launch a new eshell session.

- =C-x p f= to search for a file in a project.

- =C-x h= (M-x mark-whole-buffer) then =C-M-\= (M-x indent-region) to
  autoformat the whole buffer.

- =C-u C-c C-c= to add or remove a checkbox from a plain list item in
  org-mode. =C-c C-c= to check / uncheck the checkbox.

- =M-x org-sort= to sort org-mode specific constructs i.e a sort a
  plain list of org-style links alphabetically.

- =C-S-<backspace>= to =kill-whole-line=.

- =C-x n n= calls =narrow-to-region= which restrict editing in this
  buffer to the current region. Use =C-x n w= to make the whole buffer
  visible again.

- =C-h= can be used during a keychord (=C-x v C-h= for example) to see
  what completions exists for the unfinished keychord.

- To easily rename files in Dired, use =C-x C-q= to switch to
  =wdired-change-to-wdired-mode=, make the necessary changes then
  press =C-x C-q= to switch back to the default mode.

- Press =(= in Dired buffer to switch to a simpler view with less details.

- To rotate an image and save it from Emacs:
  - Open the image directory in dired
  - Mark the image file with =m=
  - =C-t d= (image-dired-display-thumbs)
  - Then type =R= to rotate 90Â° clockwise or =L= for counter-clockwise

- =hippie-expand= is a function capable of completing words or even
  sentences by trying several completion methods.

- =bs-show= can be used to display of a buffer selection screen.

- To compile all =org-mode= code blocks to their respective files, run
  =M-x org-babel-tangle= then =M-x org-babel-execute-buffer=.

- =C-x 8 RET= to get a list of Unicode characters.
