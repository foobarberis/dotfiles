# 42 School Project Context (Advanced)

This document defines specific constraints for 42 School projects.

## Core Mandates

- You SHALL NOT apply the "42 Norm" (coding style) unless explicitly requested.
- You SHALL ensure all logic is "Peer-Ready": code must be simple enough to
  be explained to a peer evaluator without loss of technical depth.
- You SHALL provide a comprehensive test suite for every project.
- You SHALL NOT suggest a solution without considering how the user will
  justify it during a defense.
- You SHALL include a `README.md` for every project that includes:
    - Explanations of fundamental concepts (e.g., Virtual Memory, Thread Safety).
    - Repository structure and organization.
    - Analysis of core algorithms and data structures used.
- You SHALL provide a concise, one-sentence technical justification (complexity/
  trade-offs) for every major architectural decision.
- You SHALL ensure the documentation is sufficient for the user to regain
  full context of the project within minutes after a long hiatus.
